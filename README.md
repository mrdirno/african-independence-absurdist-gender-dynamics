## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character must negotiate for a vital resource (water, medicine, fuel) using only the bureaucratic language of a now-irrelevant colonial manual.
- Compose a monologue from Auntie Precious's perspective as she organizes the first post-independence national holiday, navigating between tradition, political spectacle, and a severe shortage of tablecloths.
- Describe the moment a minor female clerk in the new ministry discovers a hidden room containing something the British didn't take—something utterly mundane yet symbolically explosive.
- Imagine a dialogue between Makeda's machine and the ghost of the colonial surveyor whose theodolite lens she salvaged. What does the machine see that he never could?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a digital 'Sundries Ledger'—an interactive archive that catalogs not just what was taken, but the functional and philosophical void each missing item left behind, allowing users to draw connections between absences.
- Design a text-based game where the player, as a protocol officer in the new state, must navigate a day of diplomatic visits with a constantly shifting set of broken tools, missing documents, and performative expectations.
